# Data-Pagination-and-Filtering

JS Project 2

Project Overview

In this project, I used a common web development technique known as “pagination” to enhance the usability of a web page.

I started with a file that contains information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. I had to use  JavaScript to display the first nine students on the page. Then I added navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students.

The application had to work with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied array of 42 students. The solution needed to be flexible enough to handle arrays of student data of various lengths.
